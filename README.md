# ShowUpdated

### ShowUpdated is a simple program to show what shows in your personal media collection are currently up to date and what are missing seasons.

This program is very much in early early alpha. 
Changes will be made over the coming weeks to add new functionality, fix bugs, and clean up how it works. 

## Installation Instructions:
Installing and running this program is currently somewhat complex. 
    -   You need to have a functioning Python environment. 
    -   From within the directory run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
